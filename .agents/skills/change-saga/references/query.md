# Reading a Saga through the query API

`change-saga query` is the versioned read API. Use it for every read of an
existing Saga; never glob, grep, or read its metadata files. It is
deterministic, paginated, and safe to call concurrently; it never starts a
server and never mutates either repository.

## The envelope

Pass `--saga <path>` to every query, and `--repo <source-checkout>` when the
source repository is separate. Pass `--against REV` (and optionally `--head
REV`) to read one comparison; without it a query observes the head. The one
exception is `change-saga query schema <operation>`, which describes that
operation's data paths and pagination contract without opening a Saga. Use it
instead of probing or guessing response shapes.

Every invocation writes exactly one JSON envelope carrying `schema`, `ok`,
`snapshot`, `data`, and `page`; failures carry `error.code`. Branch on `ok` and
`error.code`; never parse message text. Each cursor schema names the response
collection counted by `page.total` and `page.returned` as
`pagination.counted_path`: the current page length at that path must equal
`page.returned`. Follow `page.next_cursor` while `page.has_more` is true, and
confirm the aggregate count equals `page.total`. Do not raise `--limit` to
silently swallow a partial result. Compare `snapshot` across calls to detect a
Saga that changed underneath a multi-step read.

## Navigating

Start at `query overview` and walk one level at a time with `query children`.
Read a slide with `change-saga diagram describe --slide TARGET <saga>`: compact
text with its takeaway, Items in reading order, and a diagram's elements and
connections, without asset bytes. Use `query slide` only when you need the raw
visual or complete Item evidence, and `query slide-diffs` for Item evidence
atoms; read narrative content through `query fragment`. A fragment's
children are its landmarks, and each one reports the target URN to pass to
`change-saga cover --target`. Navigate evidence in both directions with `query
fragment-diffs` and `query diff-owners`, and page completeness problems with
`query gaps --kind uncovered|stale|overlap --against <base>`.

Hierarchy nodes report inclusive `diffs.current` and `diffs.stale` totals plus
`direct_current`, `direct_stale`, `descendant_current`, and
`descendant_stale`, so evidence owned by a landmark or child is not mistaken
for a node with no explained code.

## Feature-first reads

Use `query context --feature ID|URN` when the task starts from one durable
feature. Its compact, paged projection carries owned story and criterion
identities, one-hop neighbors, linked terms and their two semantic axes,
visual Item links and evidence counts, gaps, and conflicts without repeating
full prose or code references. Use `--expand STORY-ID|URN` for one owned story
when exact prose, citations, relation records, and code evidence are needed;
expansion and cursors are mutually exclusive. The projection is deliberately
bounded and reports its inclusions and exclusions in `data.completeness`.

Use `query audit --feature ID|URN` for the read-only feature handoff check. It
does not accept `--against`; `--head` selects the source revision whose Item
selectors are resolved. Exit `8` means the command produced a valid audit with
blocking findings or unresolved conflicts, not that the query failed. Current
canonical Item-to-requirement links may cross feature ownership and still
satisfy exact Item intent or an owned criterion explanation. Such ownership is
reported as informational context and does not by itself block readiness;
stale, invalid, retired, or conflicted endpoints and genuine intent/evidence
gaps still do.

## Personas, terms, and their explicit references

Use `query personas --persona ID|URN` for a complete current persona definition
and `query terms --term ID|URN` for the corresponding term definition and code
health. Selection is by stable identity only; never substitute a display name.
Retired records remain readable. If a query reports competing heads, preserve
them and do not infer a current definition.

Use `query persona-references` or `query term-references` to inspect direct
explicit uses. Page to completion and read `data.completeness` as part of the
answer: it names covered typed fields and canonical relations, unresolved
conflicted owners, and the deliberately excluded prose, SVG text, historical,
and transitive classes. Each result identifies the exact owner, selector, and
provenance. Do not claim that excluded text was searched or that a lexical
match is a semantic dependency.

Unresolved owners have their own bounded `unresolved_page`, independent of the
primary reference page and still present when no references resolve. Follow
`unresolved_page.next_cursor` with `--conflict-cursor` until its `has_more` is
false; `--conflict-limit` controls that page size and otherwise inherits
`--limit` or the default. Do not treat a complete primary reference traversal
as complete while unresolved conflict pages remain.

`query terms` without `--limit` or `--cursor` preserves the legacy complete
term collection. Supply `--limit` to opt into bounded enumeration and follow
the returned cursor. Persona enumeration and both reference operations are
always bounded. A cursor is operation-, filter-, and snapshot-specific; restart
the traversal after `stale_snapshot` and never reuse a cursor with another
operation.

There is no guarded name-only rename command yet. Use the existing explicit
persona or term revision operation only when the task authorizes a deliberate
revision and supplies the required parents and revision identity. Never emulate
a rename by editing files, changing a URN, rewriting prose/SVG, or repinning or
approving dependencies.

## Technical inventory

`query inventory` reports each Component/System with the exact revisions it
answers about (`selected`), their explicit intent, declared use counts and
code health. Intent is `unspecified` for legacy revisions; never infer it.
`--intent` filters explicit intent. `--new` requires `--against`: newness is
identity introduction relative to that base, independent of intent, and an
unreadable base fails with `baseline_unknown` rather than making everything
new. `--feature` restricts to pins reachable from that feature's
implementation Items and returns the declared `scope_paths`. Filters never
remove unresolved records: page `data.unresolved` with `--conflict-cursor`
until `data.completeness.unresolved_page.has_more` is false.

`query inventory-uses --target URN [--depth N]` pages declared reverse uses;
read `data.completeness` before claiming a definition is unused.
`query inventory-coverage` measures code accounted for by the inventory in a
named `--path` scope. It is not implementation-deck or review coverage, and
covered lines are not proof of a correct explanation.
